We've all seen it, and we all know what it looks like. It looks like the same stuff you see in your spam folder when you look at your email.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because each post flagged as spam comes with a **-100** reputation penalty, and the risk of users being fed into the spam blocking systems, these should generally **not be flagged as spam**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there is a different issue at hand: *self promotion*. The [help center](http://devops.stackexchange.com/help/behavior) has a good section on this I'll quote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Avoid overt self-promotion.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The community tends to vote down overt self-promotion and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, that’s okay. However, you must disclose your affiliation in your answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If a large percentage of your posts include a mention of your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong reasons. Our advertising rates are quite reasonable; contact our ad sales team for details. We also offer free community promotion ads for open source projects and non-profit organizations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That captures it really well in my opinion—if you're clearly just here to try and sell your product, then you're not here for the right reasons, but if you *genuinely* think your product could solve a problem, it's fine to share it **in a small percentage of your posts**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would say the most balanced approach would be to vote on the posts based on how useful you find them—if you think it's unhelpful, vote down, although using a custom flag to explain that you think the promotion is inappropriate would also be acceptable generally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, a **self-answer** does raise some suspicion, but I'd personally give people the benefit of the doubt at this stage—it's easy to get caught on the wrong side of self-promotion rules, and if the *intention* was good, I wouldn't object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I think would make a *better* answer is something along these lines:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Q: **How do I solve foo?**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A: I wanted to solve this, so I investigated these approaches:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Bar&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Baz&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Baz works particularly well because _______. I developed this idea into a product ([insert relevant link here]) which may be helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This way, you're teaching everyone else how to solve problems while still giving them a pre-made solution and a link to your project. Sharing your relevant *experiences and solutions* while developing the product would be fascinating. A description of what your product does... a little less so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

And many, many of my (upvoted) answers to questions about &quot;module recommendations&quot; (question like &quot;Which module can I use to do X or Y in Drupal?&quot;) got deleted (not just closed ...) as off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After digging deeper in the SE-concepts, I have learned that on many sites similar software recommendations are also considered as off-topic, mostly with an explanation like &quot;they are simply not a good fit for Q&amp;A sites&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### My recommendation&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Option 1**: Teach users who ask questions about SW recommendations to rephrase their question to ***How to*** questions about the actual issue they want to address. That kind of questions leaves plenty of room to post answers that are ... about SW recommendations that may be a perfect fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Option 2**: Promote questions about SW recommendations to be posted on the SE-site that is dedicated to only that, i.e. ... ***Software Recommendations*** (disclosure: I'm a reviewer there ...)!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Option 3**: Consider the Software Recommendations site as a possible migration target for any such questions on DevOps that get closed as off-topic. But make sure that only high quality questions are considered for such possible migration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://drupal.stackexchange.com/" />

There's no clue of what is intended to do with jenkins, which by nature is very volatile from just linting jobs to Continuous Delivery pipeline.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I assume this is due to the wish to create a canonical question from problems encountered or question we had ourselves and willing to write them in a less 'personal' way so they are useful to more people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's others examples which have the same kind of problem in my opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [What is a 'Feature Flag Toggle' and when to use them (or not)?](http://devops.stackexchange.com/revisions/344/1) first revision, which has been edited in a better format&#xD;&#xA; - [How is Ansible different from simply running a provisioning bash shell in Vagrant?](http://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/342/how-is-ansible-different-from-simply-running-a-provisioning-bash-shell-in-vagran) which could be worded differently by taking an actual use case so answers can focus on what gives an advantage over the other and extend on a more generic comparison&#xD;&#xA; - [How to design authentication and authorization in micro-services architecture?](http://devops.stackexchange.com/revisions/253/1) first revision, which again should be more focused.&#xD;&#xA; - [How to design authentication and authorization in micro-services architecture?](http://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/253/how-to-design-authentication-and-authorization-in-micro-services-architecture) same as above in its current version, still with a generic goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I fear is that either answers will be very long (if they fit in 30k chars) or that it will attract a bunch of vague answers on what is better to do on answer's author opinion, not exactly addressing the concerns and/or missing part of the question by focusing on only one point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While we can downvote, and then delete bad answers, this may create a lot of clean up work which would be better spend elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So my question is: should we not aim at more focused and practical questions to avoid this ?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like those:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [How to persuade developers to start using feature flag toggles?](http://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/341/how-to-persuade-developers-to-start-using-feature-flag-toggles)&#xD;&#xA; - [How can I communicate queue-based processing delays to non-technical team members?](http://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/370/how-can-i-communicate-queue-based-processing-delays-to-non-technical-team-member)" />

There are two aspects I see about these questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Are they on-topic?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, I think so. It'd be hard for me to argue that questions about serverless computing, feature flags and black box testing **aren't** relevant to the topics of a DevOps-related Q&amp;A site. But...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Are they questions we should encourage?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Probably not, especially in the ***expert-level private beta*** phase. The idea is that questions should be setting the tone and showing new users *what this site is about*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could almost say, _&quot;We gave DevOps experts a few weeks to come up with the best questions they could—questions which can be used to make the case for creating a new site—and they came up with these.&quot;_. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions like &quot;What is X?&quot; or &quot;Why should I use Y?&quot; **do not** make the case. The blog post [*Are Some Questions Too Simple?*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/02/22/are-some-questions-too-simple/) makes this point well in my view, so I'll quote it here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The key distinction to make here, in my mind, is that all questions are ultimately in service of the people answering them. That is the audience you need to satisfy if you want to have any hope of creating and sustaining a community of peers learning from each other. The minimum bar for a question is not “is this on-topic?”, but rather “is this somewhat interesting and on-topic?”. I’m not saying every question needs to be utterly fascinating, but please endeavor to make your questions more than a constant stream of no-duh underhanded softballs requiring nothing more than a quick cut and paste from Wikipedia, IMDB, or some other standard internet reference site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **There’s nothing useful any expert can learn from ultra-basic questions. Allow your Q&amp;A; community to fill itself with enough “General Reference” type questions and you’ll soon find no experts there at all.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the 'General Reference' close reason was abandoned because it ended up being used to get rid of anything that people didn't like. [As stated in this Meta answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/88521/336144), it didn't pan out quite like you might hope, and I would imagine being on the receiving end felt a bit harsh—some users thought your question was too simple, so, ***no answer for you***!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you take nothing else from my post, I strongly encourage everyone to review the [page you were shown before asking your first question](http://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask-beta):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### You get the site you build&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The first questions set the tone and topic of a site for a long time. Those early questions say a lot about what your community could become. And questions asked during the private beta will be on the front page when potential experts see your site for the first time. So please make those first questions exemplary ones that are interesting, challenging, and worthy of imitation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Make this site *worth* opening up, and it'll do well. Allow this site to fill up with questions that are better answered by Googling, and people will just turn to Google instead.**" />

We've all seen it, and we all know what it looks like. It looks like the same stuff you see in your spam folder when you look at your email.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because each post flagged as spam comes with a **-100** reputation penalty, and the risk of users being fed into the spam blocking systems, these should generally **not be flagged as spam**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there is a different issue at hand: *self promotion*. The [help center](http://devops.stackexchange.com/help/behavior) has a good section on this I'll quote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Avoid overt self-promotion.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The community tends to vote down overt self-promotion and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, that’s okay. However, you must disclose your affiliation in your answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If a large percentage of your posts include a mention of your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong reasons. Our advertising rates are quite reasonable; contact our ad sales team for details. We also offer free community promotion ads for open source projects and non-profit organizations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That captures it really well in my opinion—if you're clearly just here to try and sell your product, then you're not here for the right reasons, but if you *genuinely* think your product could solve a problem, it's fine to share it **in a small percentage of your posts**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would say the most balanced approach would be to vote on the posts based on how useful you find them—if you think it's unhelpful, vote down, although using a custom flag to explain that you think the promotion is inappropriate would also be acceptable generally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, a **self-answer** does raise some suspicion, but I'd personally give people the benefit of the doubt at this stage—it's easy to get caught on the wrong side of self-promotion rules, and if the *intention* was good, I wouldn't object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I think would make a *better* answer is something along these lines:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Q: **How do I solve foo?**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A: I wanted to solve this, so I investigated these approaches:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Bar&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Baz&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Baz works particularly well because _______. I developed this idea into a product ([insert relevant link here]) which may be helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This way, you're teaching everyone else how to solve problems while still giving them a pre-made solution and a link to your project.

There are two aspects I see about these questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Are they on-topic?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, I think so. It'd be hard for me to argue that questions about serverless computing, feature flags and black box testing **aren't** relevant to the topics of a DevOps-related Q&amp;A site. But...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Are they questions we should encourage?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Probably not, especially in the ***expert-level private beta*** phase. The idea is that questions should be setting the tone and showing new users *what this site is about*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could almost say, _&quot;We gave DevOps experts a few weeks to come up with the best questions they could—questions which can be used to make the case for creating a new site—and they came up with these.&quot;_. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions like &quot;What is X?&quot; or &quot;Why should I use Y?&quot; **do not** make the case. The blog post [*Are Some Questions Too Simple?*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/02/22/are-some-questions-too-simple/) makes this point well in my view, so I'll quote it here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The key distinction to make here, in my mind, is that all questions are ultimately in service of the people answering them. That is the audience you need to satisfy if you want to have any hope of creating and sustaining a community of peers learning from each other. The minimum bar for a question is not “is this on-topic?”, but rather “is this somewhat interesting and on-topic?”. I’m not saying every question needs to be utterly fascinating, but please endeavor to make your questions more than a constant stream of no-duh underhanded softballs requiring nothing more than a quick cut and paste from Wikipedia, IMDB, or some other standard internet reference site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **There’s nothing useful any expert can learn from ultra-basic questions. Allow your Q&amp;A; community to fill itself with enough “General Reference” type questions and you’ll soon find no experts there at all.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the 'General Reference' close reason was abandoned because it ended up being used to get rid of anything that people didn't like. [As stated in this Meta answer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/88521/336144), it didn't pan out quite like you might hope, and I would imagine being on the receiving end felt a bit harsh—some users thought your question was too simple, so, ***no answer for you***!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you take nothing else from my post, I strongly encourage everyone to review the [page you were shown before asking your first question](http://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask-beta):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### You get the site you build&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The first questions set the tone and topic of a site for a long time. Those early questions say a lot about what your community could become. And questions asked during the private beta will be on the front page when potential experts see your site for the first time. So please make those first questions exemplary ones that are interesting, challenging, and worthy of imitation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Make this site *worth* opening up, and it'll do well.

The question becomes subjective or unbounded: &quot;list me all container engines&quot; or &quot;what's your favorite build manager?&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Fortunately, most of the folks who *need* to ask these questions do have an actual problem they're looking to solve - they've just assumed that the solution will take a particular form, and thus produced [an X-Y question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/233676#233676). Demanding that all recommendation questions describe the problem to be solved side-steps this issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. **No actual solutions.** This is the one where every spammer descends on the site to post links to their webpage in response to these questions, and is *strongly* encouraged by pitfall #1 - if you're just looking for a list of things, &quot;this is a *thing*&quot; becomes a valid (albeit terribly unhelpful) answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Ruthlessly culling answers that don't describe a specific solution to the problem in the question avoids this issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. **Out-of-date answers.** This is slightly less of a concern for *software* recommendations; you *know* that &quot;best price/capacity SSD&quot; is gonna age pretty fast, but an answer that describes how to configure a certain software package to solve a specific problem could potentially remain valid for years. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Critically, focusing on the *how* rather than the *what* makes it much easier to determine when an answer has gone to seed; if you've avoided pitfalls #1 and #2, you'll be well-prepared to handle #3 as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, **my advice is to allow these questions for now**, keeping these pitfalls in mind and also [the guidance found on Software Recommendations' Ask page](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/ask):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Tell us...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - ...the task you want to accomplish&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - ...your requirements for that task&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - ...what you already know about software available for this purpose&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then, write a specific and to-the-point title&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One caution: **avoid a rec-question gold-rush.** It's *really* tempting, when these sites are just getting started, to post a bunch of fake &quot;recommendation&quot; questions for software you already use, mostly as a way to get to know what everyone *else* is using. These are worthless long-term, and set a bad example for everyone who follows - if you're bored &amp; just wanna know what software your peers are happy with, [drop into chat &amp; ask them!](http://chat.stackexchange.com/?tab=site&amp;host=devops.stackexchange.com)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This question would most likely be closed cause &lt; mention the reason properly and clearly &gt;`, and give the OP some time for revisiting the post, and properly edit it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the OP still doesn't edit/improve the post to fit into the community's policies, then by all means, go ahead and close it off.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, posts which are blatantly off-topic or which looks like `copy-pasted homework` or which displays significant lack of effort(like, basic error googling, etc), **should** be closed down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, don't expect all the users to be as constructive as you are.

Commenting to let the author know the concern is not mandatory, I do think it is constructive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next voting to close a question is actually an indication at least 5 users think there's a problem with this question.&#xD;&#xA;For too broad, which I assume is your main concern, that's because those users think it won't have a useful outcome.  &#xD;&#xA;Either because answering the question can't fit in the format of the site and would be better addressed in a blog post, or because it is not scoped enough and answers will start to pile until finding the gem answer within all will just hide it; [Example here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1644/what-good-technology-podcasts-are-out-there) of something where after a while it's absolutely unpractical.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may dislike it, but closing a question is already a constructive thing, enforcing the asker to search why the community think its question is not a good fit for the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Goal of SE sites is to build a knowledge base which should not fade off with time whereas possible.

That indeed save energy, as if the author doesn't like your opinion and don't review its question you won't have to get back periodically to check and finally cast your vote if nothing changed. Moreover when you comment the author can ping you after reviewing its post with `@nickname` to let you know a change has been made.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This had already happened, with the help of a meta question for guidance [here](https://devops.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33/how-can-i-improve-a-question-about-comparing-technical-solutions)" />

Cultural changes in particular are in a really bad spot initially because they have to at least partially invalidate an established scale of values or practices. Which many won't accept easily (or even at all), at least at the beginning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm just a bit surprised that you are surprised to encounter resistance ;) My suggestion is to not take it at heart. Many of those trying to embrace DevOps don't quite know how - they're still used with the old ways. But they try. And some succeed. DevOps is about making that happen. But patience, inclusion and communication are keys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A similar thing happens here: yes, there are rules for SE sites. And no one has been successful in doing an SE site like the one you're expecting. So no one knows exactly if creating such site is possible and, if it is, how it's done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So just give it a bit more time - we've only been in (private) beta for less then 3 weeks and we have less than 100 members actually active, other site have been in beta for years and have 100s/1000s of members. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Test the flexibility of the boundaries - ask the questions you'd like to ask. Don't get upset if they're not well received presently. Most likely those that can change didn't have enough time to do so. And if the current majority won't get swayed don't despair - that majority is too small to be representative for the future community. But once the audience grows significantly maybe others would like them too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Same DevOps keys apply: patience, inclusion and communication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My 2c.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

I'm active on the site every day.  I'm in the American Central time zone.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've been working intensively in DevOps and Agile for three years.  I've presented on DevOps at conferences including the DevOps Enterprise Summit in 2014. I have been a StackOverflow user since the beta in 2008.  I am also writing a book about DevOps tools: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://devopskatas.com  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of my experience in moderation comes from answering/asking on StackOverflow for the last eight years. I'm active on SO in closing questions that can't be answered, commenting on questions that can be &quot;saved&quot; with a little more clarification, and spot-editing questions that need a little spelling/grammatical help. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thank you for your consideration!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;" />

Eight and a half years later and the site is ranked in the top 50 most visited sites in the world and is the defacto standard for getting answers to questions, spawning many more sites in the StackExchange network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![StackExchange][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The StackExchange network is an extension of the StackOverflow concept, allowing for new sites modelled after StackOverflow to be proposed, taken into private and public beta with the goal of eventually becoming a fully fledged part of the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A little over a month ago now a new site entered private beta, it's based on a topic close to my heart, specifically DevOps. You could be forgiven for thinking that DevOps questions should appear on StackOverflow or the sister site ServerFault, however many questions about Culture, Tools, Transformation and Techniques have been closed because they are off-topic - the new DevOps StackExchange Beta is the place that these questions can be asked and answered freely, by example we have had these questions posted in the last 30 days:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [What is a &quot;Walking Skeleton&quot;?][3]&#xD;&#xA; - [How to explain DevOps to a non-techy manager?][4]&#xD;&#xA; - [Who is this Chaos Monkey and why did he crash my server?][5]&#xD;&#xA; - [What is SecOps?][6]&#xD;&#xA; - [Which university has a good postgraduate DevOps programme?][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Who is involved?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a small core of five to six users who are using the site on a regular basis and another thirty or so whom we see on a semi-regular basis.

We have an opportunity here to build a community that espouses the principles of the DevOps community whilst gathering answers to the questions we have about DevOps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How do I get involved?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Signing up to any StackExchange site is easy, just head over to the site and click the Sign In button at the top.

Do you have experience in DevOps, I am sure you do, take a look at the unanswered questions and jump right in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally am excited by this proposal, looking forward to seeing you on the site and answering your questions very soon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4HOC.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XS5Z7.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://devops.stackexchange.com/q/712/397&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://devops.stackexchange.com/q/643/397&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://devops.stackexchange.com/q/609/397&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://devops.stackexchange.com/q/686/397&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://devops.stackexchange.com/q/599/397" />

I've answered [this one](http://devops.stackexchange.com/admin/posts/timeline/810) yesterday which has been asked on April 7th and did stay 4 days days without answer.  &#xD;&#xA;And for [this one](http://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/838/where-does-circleci-2-0-store-the-ssh-private-keys) I did just dig into the documentation, that's far from a good answer in my opinion and someone comfortable with Circle-CI should add an answer with more details and best practices extending over to multiple keys management.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I suggest that those individuals actually refrain from participating&#xD;&#xA;&gt; until others have already contributed to a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How long until someone having an answer can post it if no one post ? 4 days ? a week ? a month ? When do you think it would be acceptable someone you have grief over post an answer if no one has done one ?  &#xD;&#xA;Corollary: do you really think that's fair for the question author to leave them without answer for an extended period of time for imaginary reputation points ?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Otherwise there's little point for someone like myself contributing to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a community when 1-2 people are already answering all the questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and their answers automatically have high visibility.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's no more visibility for an answer or another, each answer added bump a question on the top of the homepage, so any answer even on a very old post will get visibility. There's a badge for answers getting more votes than the accepted answer also: [populist](http://devops.stackexchange.com/help/badges/39/populist) along with badges for well received answers.  &#xD;&#xA;I would recommend going through [How do I write a good answer?](http://devops.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) for advice to write good answer even if existing one are there.  &#xD;&#xA;You didn't give any example of question you had like to answer and was discouraged from, so we can't have any idea of what you're interested in nor a starting point to get background from your post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I suppose if the goal of the community is NOT to attract additional&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contributors, and you're fine just creating a google searchable&#xD;&#xA;&gt; archive of 1-2 people's opinions, then you're on the right track.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, I think numerous opinions from a diverse array of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contributors is preferable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here I've a problem with your approach, we're not here to build a collection of opinions but a collection of answers to problems.

Demanding that all recommendation questions describe the problem to be solved side-steps this issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. **No actual solutions.** This is the one where every spammer descends on the site to post links to their webpage in response to these questions, and is *strongly* encouraged by pitfall #1 - if you're just looking for a list of things, &quot;this is a *thing*&quot; becomes a valid (albeit terribly unhelpful) answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Ruthlessly culling answers that don't describe a specific solution to the problem in the question avoids this issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. **Out-of-date answers.** This is slightly less of a concern for *software* recommendations; you *know* that &quot;best price/capacity SSD&quot; is gonna age pretty fast, but an answer that describes how to configure a certain software package to solve a specific problem could potentially remain valid for years. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Critically, focusing on the *how* rather than the *what* makes it much easier to determine when an answer has gone to seed; if you've avoided pitfalls #1 and #2, you'll be well-prepared to handle #3 as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, **my advice is to allow these questions for now**, keeping these pitfalls in mind and also [the guidance found on Software Recommendations' Ask page](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/ask):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Tell us...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - ...the task you want to accomplish&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - ...your requirements for that task&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - ...what you already know about software available for this purpose&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then, write a specific and to-the-point title&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One caution: **avoid a rec-question gold-rush.** It's *really* tempting, when these sites are just getting started, to post a bunch of fake &quot;recommendation&quot; questions for software you already use, mostly as a way to get to know what everyone *else* is using. These are worthless long-term, and set a bad example for everyone who follows - if you're bored &amp; just wanna know what software your peers are happy with, [drop into chat &amp; ask them!](http://chat.stackexchange.com/?tab=site&amp;host=devops.stackexchange.com)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The reader will have to read through them, figure out why someone suggested something and why someone suggested something else. And then 2) in in a year or two, the secret management field will have changed and these answers will probably be invalid (not obsolete, they'll be downright wrong in regards to the new standards). The preferred way to do secret management will have changed and you have to *hope* that someone posted an updated answer and *hope* that it gets up-voted enough to have some visibility.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Specific questions are better, if you ask how to manage rotation key secret in Consul with Spring Boot it protects you to some extent from those change over time in tools and procedures. If someone is still using Spring Boot with Consul in 4 years, well.. they will have a very specific answer to their problem. That's a good thing. To the rest of the community which will have moved on to &quot;NextGenSecretMgmtTool&quot;, this question about Consul will just appear obsolete and won't tell them how to secret management and won't suggest to use Consul.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PS: I have nothing against Consul, all I'm trying to illustrate is that tools and techniques change over time and the answers written usually won't." />

We've all seen it, and we all know what it looks like. It looks like the same stuff you see in your spam folder when you look at your email.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because each post flagged as spam comes with a **-100** reputation penalty, and the risk of users being fed into the spam blocking systems, these should generally **not be flagged as spam**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there is a different issue at hand: *self promotion*. The [help center](https://devops.stackexchange.com/help/behavior) has a good section on this I'll quote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Avoid overt self-promotion.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The community tends to vote down overt self-promotion and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, that’s okay. However, you must disclose your affiliation in your answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If a large percentage of your posts include a mention of your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong reasons. Our advertising rates are quite reasonable; contact our ad sales team for details. We also offer free community promotion ads for open source projects and non-profit organizations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That captures it really well in my opinion—if you're clearly just here to try and sell your product, then you're not here for the right reasons, but if you *genuinely* think your product could solve a problem, it's fine to share it **in a small percentage of your posts**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would say the most balanced approach would be to vote on the posts based on how useful you find them—if you think it's unhelpful, vote down, although using a custom flag to explain that you think the promotion is inappropriate would also be acceptable generally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, a **self-answer** does raise some suspicion, but I'd personally give people the benefit of the doubt at this stage—it's easy to get caught on the wrong side of self-promotion rules, and if the *intention* was good, I wouldn't object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I think would make a *better* answer is something along these lines:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Q: **How do I solve foo?**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A: I wanted to solve this, so I investigated these approaches:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Bar&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Baz&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Baz works particularly well because _______. I developed this idea into a product ([insert relevant link here]) which may be helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This way, you're teaching everyone else how to solve problems while still giving them a pre-made solution and a link to your project. Sharing your relevant *experiences and solutions* while developing the product would be fascinating. A description of what your product does... a little less so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This could happen for a variety of reasons, such as a user finding a user's great answer and visiting all of their posts to upvote them, or a user getting into an argument with another user and downvoting their posts indiscriminately in revenge. No matter the cause, this sort of systematic targeted voting is not considered normal behavior and the system will not allow it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Comment on downvotes!!!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Really, seriously, please! Any time I ***notice*** an anonymous downvote on any of my questions or answers, it makes me think like `Gggggggrrrrrrr²`. Because IMO only motivated downvotes (by leaving a comment to motivate the downvote) is what counts: those are the ones that will challenge the user who created the question (or answer) to try to improve the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And then there are 2 types of anonymous downvotes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- For questions ... which make me think like  `Gggggggrrrrrrr³`. Because they are so cheap (the downvoter does not &quot;have to pay&quot; something like &quot;`-1`&quot; rep decrease, as is the case for downvotes of answers ...). My remedy for those = just ignore them (why bother, just move on).&#xD;&#xA;- For answers ... but those don't even make me think like `Gggggggrrrrrrr` anymore.

If you're fast enough and go check the weekly top-voters page, you can see 1 user ... who yesterday had 40 votes (heading for a special badge?), but since the voting corrected from this morning got reduced again to 32 votes (only). 8 votes withdrawn, that seems to match with my rep decrease of 8 (serially) upvoted questions this morning. Now what, shouldn't the poor user above (and me too?) be rewarded with some badge that we recovered from a serial upvoting attack?

The idea is that questions should be setting the tone and showing new users *what this site is about*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could almost say, _&quot;We gave DevOps experts a few weeks to come up with the best questions they could—questions which can be used to make the case for creating a new site—and they came up with these.&quot;_. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions like &quot;What is X?&quot; or &quot;Why should I use Y?&quot; **do not** make the case. The blog post [*Are Some Questions Too Simple?*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/02/22/are-some-questions-too-simple/) makes this point well in my view, so I'll quote it here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The key distinction to make here, in my mind, is that all questions are ultimately in service of the people answering them. That is the audience you need to satisfy if you want to have any hope of creating and sustaining a community of peers learning from each other. The minimum bar for a question is not “is this on-topic?”, but rather “is this somewhat interesting and on-topic?”. I’m not saying every question needs to be utterly fascinating, but please endeavor to make your questions more than a constant stream of no-duh underhanded softballs requiring nothing more than a quick cut and paste from Wikipedia, IMDB, or some other standard internet reference site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **There’s nothing useful any expert can learn from ultra-basic questions. Allow your Q&amp;A; community to fill itself with enough “General Reference” type questions and you’ll soon find no experts there at all.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the 'General Reference' close reason was abandoned because it ended up being used to get rid of anything that people didn't like. [As stated in this Meta answer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/88521/336144), it didn't pan out quite like you might hope, and I would imagine being on the receiving end felt a bit harsh—some users thought your question was too simple, so, ***no answer for you***!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you take nothing else from my post, I strongly encourage everyone to review the [page you were shown before asking your first question](https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask-beta):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### You get the site you build&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The first questions set the tone and topic of a site for a long time. Those early questions say a lot about what your community could become. And questions asked during the private beta will be on the front page when potential experts see your site for the first time. So please make those first questions exemplary ones that are interesting, challenging, and worthy of imitation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Make this site *worth* opening up, and it'll do well. Allow this site to fill up with questions that are better answered by Googling, and people will just turn to Google instead.**" />

It means that if you have a better (or just different!) explanation of something than others had, you can post it - that will cause the question to get bumped to the homepage, which means your answer gets views, and generally people are pretty free with upvotes to reward good content like that.  This is much better than, say, reddit, where there's a strong bias towards the first few responses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With that being said, being quick to answer questions is also a good way to get your foot in the door.  Last year I decided I was going to become active on security.SE, and frequently checked the new question list; this got me from 300 to 7500 rep in 6 months.

These are where there are two (or sometimes three) terms that, to someone reading their individual definitions, seem confusingly similar.  Answers to these questions then focus on the subtle distinctions or implications of the queried terms in a way that you wouldn't get from a dictionary; you *may* find them online, but often that's at a Stack Exchange site. ;)  A devops.SE example might be [&quot;What's the difference between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment?&quot;](https://stackoverflow.com/q/28608015/120999).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondly, it can be very helpful to have *canonical answers* to common questions, and sometimes these questions are asking what some term means.  It's important for the answers here to not merely be a definition, but to fully *explain* the concept.  In the &quot;What is Serverless?&quot; question linked in the question, a good answer (like the one we have from Aurora0001) does not merely *define* serverless, but explains the motivations behind it and why you would want to choose it (or choose to not use it)." />

The OP might find a much happier home on ServerFault where there are 20 unanswered questions for every hour of the day.  Or if they work better with fire hoses head over to StackOverflow itself.  Then once you've reached the 200 rep to get the 100 [association bonus](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/141648/what-is-the-association-bonus) on each new site life becomes much easier.  This doesn't mean that you will suddenly be gaining lots of rep on sites like DevOps (or even my favorite [Bricks](https://bricks.stackexchange.com/)) which are simply low-volume at this point in their lives.  I have sites that I've been on for over a year where I've only gained 4 or 6 rep in my entire time there.  I don't see anything wrong with that if I'm learning and I'm contributing as best I can in most cases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A significant secondary factor is that some of this also comes down to **luck and timing**.  I've written hundreds of answers in my time on these sites, but after two years I was in the right place at the right time with the [right answer](https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/8815/how-do-i-center-a-2x2-plate-on-a-3x3-plate/8816#8816) and folks loved it.  I had no idea *that* answer would be so much more well received than all of the previous effort I put in.  I had prior answers that had their own github repos, but that &quot;huge&quot; effort wasn't as well received as something I dashed off quickly to help somebody out with their LEGO projects.  That's just luck and timing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A third component of this that I haven't seen previously mentioned: maybe the OP just doesn't like us.  Ops folks have a well-deserved reputation for being jerks or curmudgeons so this isn't a surprising result to old timers.  (And I don't think the Dev folks with their wild optimism are any easier to deal with.)  Regardless of our presumed faults, sometimes folks just don't get along.  Part of the beauty of the StackExchange model is that there are lots of other communities where you might find a vibe more to your liking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I wish the OP better luck in finding a happy home on StackExchange.  Ultimately I think being able to give back to a community which has done so much to make my job and life easier and more fun is a worthwhile endeavor.  " />

But this still means that we will get python questions for Salt Stack and Ruby questions Puppet - questions that are nearly purely programming-related and bound to be better supported by other Stack Exchange sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, we also need to know not just how we distinguish what is on or off-topic (which is really squishy, nebulous and arbitrary at this time), but how we can boil that down succinctly into an elevator pitch. It seems to me until we answer the two questions above, it is unclear how users of this site get any value from it that they could not otherwise already get on one of the many overlapping sister sites and we will be unable to put together a successful or good elevator pitch." />

You can compare this to [What's the difference between DevOps and Automation?](https://devops.stackexchange.com/q/3/13) which has 32 votes for only 639 views.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now to answer the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any question related to DevOps (culture/methodology) and the tooling for software lifecycle (infrastructure automation/build/CI/CD) from anyone of any role is welcome.  &#xD;&#xA;General rule apply that the question should be scoped enough to not need writing a book to answer it. If the question is too broad, wording it on a real life exemple could help narrowing the scope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I won't try writing a list of questions &quot;we&quot; would like to see, I really prefer letting all question in and if a bad pattern arise we'll handle it when it comes." />

The very existence of [Software Recommendations][1] proves they *can be* a good fit for a Q&amp;A site and, more importantly, even **by StackExchange standards**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, so what makes a software recommendation question on-topic or off-topic on a particular SE site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- on SO all such questions are off topic&#xD;&#xA;- on Software Recommendations there are pretty clear guidelines for both [questions][2] and [answers][3] &#xD;&#xA;- on DevOps - still TBD presently&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And even if the context of the recommendation question is very specific and well defined, making it a good fit for Software Recommendations it still doesn't necessarily mean it should be off-topic here. If it's DevOps related it should IMHO be on-topic on DevOps - after all one of the reasons for DevOps is to be a one-stop shop for all DevOps-related Q&amp;As, see [Isn't duplicate of server fault?][4] And maybe http://meta.devops.stackexchange.com/questions/3/should-we-start-moving-on-topic-questions-from-so-and-serverfault-to-here&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at it from a different prospective: to have some decent odds of getting quality and timely DevOps-related software/tool recommendations a lot of DevOps experts would have to also be fairly active on Software Recommendations. Meaning less time spent on the DevOps site itself :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, the most important category of software recommendations questions I'd like to see on-topic on this site are the not-so-well-defined context ones which wouldn't make it on Software Recommendations or some other SE site: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- DevOps related&#xD;&#xA;- maybe with connections to other posts covering in one way or the other the specific aspect for which the request for the recommendation is made&#xD;&#xA;- even if not particularly tied to a specific application context (OS/language/framework/etc) - they can still be valuable for reference from wider scope questions (culture/guidelines/process/etc) which I believe we'll see on this site&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also I think we shouldn't necessarily expect a `correct` answer from these questions. Or non-opinionated answers. Just like on Software Recommendations the answers will be opinionated and it's perfectly OK to not have an accepted one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming in the end software recommendations won't get banned on this site additional meta questions would take care of the actual guidelines of declaring them on/of-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-information&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/356/what-is-required-for-an-answer-to-be-high-quality&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22356/isnt-duplicate-of-server-fault" />
